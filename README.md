This is a nice budget app that lets you keep track of your monthly expenses and  income sources in one place. 
The app also calculates the percentage which each expense covers on the over all income and displays it on the UI.
There is also a feature where you can delete an unwanted expense/wrong entry with a single click.
The coolest thing is, it automatically calculates the remaining funds for your month and displays it right on the top of the page
after every entry.
